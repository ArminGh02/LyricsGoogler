# LyricsGoogler
Tired of typing the whole song name again and again for getting the lyrics?  
Use this script and you will be able to Google the lyrics of the song you are listening to, just by pressing a key combination.  
It works with any app in Windows (even your browser) unless that app does not support system media transport controls.  
Furthermore, it does not require the app that is playing music to be focused.
