# LyricsGoogler
Tired of typing the whole song name again and again for getting the lyrics?  
Use this script and you will be able to Google the lyrics of the song you are listening to, just by pressing a key combination.  
It works with any app in Windows (even your browser) unless that app does not support system media transport controls.  
Also it does not need the app that is playing music to be focused.

## Download
Download from [releases](github.com/ArminGh02/LyricsGoogler/releases).

## Automatic Startup
Just right click the tray icon and check the "run at startup" option.

## Changing the default key combination (which is `Win+Shift+L`)
Just right click the tray icon and click "open config file".  
Then just follow the instructions.
